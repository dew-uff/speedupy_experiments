Instructions on which release to use and how to install it can be found [here](https://github.com/dew-uff/memoization/blob/main/README.md#reproducing-the-article-analyses). Ensure that the **speedupy/** folder is located in the same directory as the main experiment script.

To execute a trial, type:

```bash
python speedupy/setup_exp/setup.py heap_permutation.py
python heap_permutation.py 4 --exec-mode manual
